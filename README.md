# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge

## About ##

This coding chalenge is for the maths game "Fizz Buzz" where each player counts inturn from 1 to say 100 but:

- If the number is divisible by **3** the the player must say **"FIZZ!"** instead of the number.
- The same occurs if the number is divisible by **5** where the player must say **"BUZZ!'**.
- If the number is divisible by **both 3 AND 5** then the player must say **"FIZZ BUZZ!"**.

The key to this coding chalenge is not only to test the coding logic but also to be able to think about adaptability and scalability:

- *What happens if the numbers 3 & 5 are changed to different values?*
- *What happens if more numbers need to be added? How easy will you code be to edit afterwards?*

Will your code need to have multiple values altered throughout the script before it can be updated to run with the new input values?
